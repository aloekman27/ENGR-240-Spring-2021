%Define variables a, b, c, and d 
a = 2.2;
b = 5.1;
c = -3.1;
d = 1.8;

%Enter commands to evaluate the expressions and assign the results 
%to the variable names given in the problem statement.  Note the values of the variables
%a, b, c, and d are defined in lines 2-5.  Be sure not to overwrite these values with your
%own code.

% code for A1
Answer1 = a*cos(b*c+d)
% code for A2
Answer2 = d * log(abs((a-b)/c))
% code for A3
Answer3 = a * exp(b) * (cos(((pi*c)/6) + d) + sin(((pi*c/6) + d)))
